# Studify

**Studify** is a study companion app that helps users plan, track, and gamify their learning routines.
This challenge focuses on building the core functionality for **processing user-uploaded documents** and **initiating personalized quiz modes using AI**.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

This project implements the following key screens and integrations based on the provided designs:

* **File Summary Screen:**
  Displays the extracted summary of documents (`PDF`, `DOCX`, `TXT`) generated by Gemini AI, or renders images (`PNG`, `JPEG`).

* **Quiz Mode Selection:**
  A custom modal bottom sheet (`QuizSelectionDialog`) for selecting the study mode.

* **Study Mode Overview Screen:**
  Displays the rules and details for the selected "Study mode" quiz, ready for the user to proceed.

* **Quiz Screen:**
  The main play screen (`QuizScreen`) featuring question display, answer selection, score tracking, time elapsed, and navigation controls.

* **Custom Navigation:**
  Implements a custom circular back button across key screens.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have Flutter installed and configured.

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK (**version 3.x or higher recommended**)
* Dart SDK
* A **Gemini API Key** (for the summarization feature)

---

### ⚙️ How to Run

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcusdashe/studify.git
cd studify_flutter_challenge
```

#### 2. Set up the Environment Variable (`.env`):

Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory and add your Gemini API key:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_KEY_HERE
```

> The application securely loads the API key from this file using a package like **flutter_dotenv** (implicitly assumed for `.env` support).

#### 3. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### 4. Run the application:

```bash
flutter run
```

## 📦 Libraries Used

This project utilizes external packages to handle file processing and AI integration:

| Package                  | Purpose                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **google_generative_ai** | Primary integration for generating AI summaries (using the `gemini-2.5-flash` model).                                            |
| **doc_text_extractor**   | Unified utility for robustly extracting plain text content from various document formats (`PDF`, `DOCX`) prior to AI processing. |
| **flutter_dotenv**       | (Implicit) Securely loads the `GEMINI_API_KEY` from the local `.env` file, keeping sensitive data out of source control.         |
| **dart:io**              | Used for accessing and reading local files (documents and images) from the device file system.                                   |

## 🎨 Design and Animation Decisions

Key UI/UX decisions were made to deliver a clean, modern, and engaging user experience:

* **Custom Back Button:**
  Replaced the default `AppBar` leading widget with a `GestureDetector`-wrapped `Container` featuring a circular white background and subtle `BoxShadow` — giving a polished, elevated navigation feel.

* **Modal Bottom Sheet (`QuizSelectionDialog`):**
  Implemented using `showModalBottomSheet` with a transparent background to present quiz options as a custom, rounded card floating above the bottom of the screen. Includes a clear "Close" button for easy dismissal.

* **Aesthetics:**
  Consistent use of a **purple/blue linear gradient** (`StudifyColors.primary` and `.primaryLight`) for all primary calls-to-action such as **Start quiz**, **Proceed**, and **Next**, maintaining a unified design language.

* **Dynamic Summary View:**
  The `FileSummaryScreen` dynamically switches between displaying full images (`Image.file`) and showing AI-generated text summaries with loading indicators for document files.

* **Quiz Screen Interactivity:**
  The `QuizScreen` provides instant visual feedback by changing the border and background color of selected options. Score and time tracking in the `AppBar` enhances the gamified learning experience.
